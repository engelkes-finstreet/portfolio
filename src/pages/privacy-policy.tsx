        <h2>General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>
        <h3>Name of the responsible entity</h3>
        <p>The responsible entity for data processing on this website is:</p>
        <p>
          <span>Engelkes Consulting</span>
          <br />
          <span>Patrick Engelkes</span>
          <br />

          <span>48153</span> <span>Münster</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The responsible entity alone or jointly with others decides on the
          purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, contact
          details, etc.).
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
        <p>
          Some data processing operations are only possible with your explicit
          consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. An informal email
          notification is sufficient for the revocation. The legality of the
          data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected
          by the revocation.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority
        </h3>
        <p>
          If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the data
          subject has the right to lodge a complaint with the competent
          supervisory authority. The competent supervisory authority for data
          protection issues is the data protection officer of the federal state
          in which our company is based. The following link provides a list of
          data protection officers and their contact details:{" "}

        </p>
        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the
          basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to
          you or to a third party. The data will be provided in a
          machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the
          data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent
          technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to information, correction, blocking, deletion</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to free information about your stored personal
          data, its origin, recipients, and the purpose of data processing, as
          well as a right to correct, block or delete this data within the scope
          of applicable legal provisions. For this purpose and for further
          questions regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time
          using the contact options listed in the imprint.
        </p>
        <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>
          For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
          content that you send to us as the site operator, our website uses SSL
          or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the
          "https://" address line of your browser and the lock symbol in the
          browser line.
        </p>
        <h2>Contact Form</h2>
        <p>
          Data transmitted via the contact form, including your contact details,
          will be stored in order to process your request or to be available for
          follow-up questions. This data will not be disclosed without your
          consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The processing of the data entered into the contact form is based
          exclusively on your consent (Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR). You can revoke
          your consent at any time. An informal email notification is sufficient
          for the revocation. The legality of the data processing operations
          carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by the
          revocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data transmitted via the contact form will remain with us until you
          request deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or there is no
          longer any need for data storage. Mandatory legal provisions -
          especially retention periods - remain unaffected.
        </p>
        <h2>Storage duration of posts and comments</h2>
        <p>
          Posts and comments as well as related data such as IP addresses are
          stored. The content remains on our website until it has been
          completely deleted or had to be deleted for legal reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The storage of posts and comments is based on your consent (Art. 6 (1)
          lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent at any time. An informal
          email notification is sufficient for the revocation. The legality of
          data processing operations that have already taken place remains
          unaffected by the revocation.

          We intend to transfer personal data to third countries outside the
          European Economic Area, especially the USA. In cases where there is no
          adequacy decision by the European Commission (e.g., in the USA), we
          have agreed on other suitable guarantees with the recipients of the
          data in accordance with Art. 44 et seq. GDPR. These are - unless
          otherwise stated - standard contractual clauses of the European
          Commission in accordance with Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of

          which you grant via the consent in the Consent Manager (or other
          forms, registrations, etc.). We would like to point out that there may
          be unknown risks (e.g., data processing by security authorities of the
          third country, the exact scope of which we do not know, and their
          consequences for you, over which we have no influence and of which you
          may not be aware) associated with transfers to third countries.
